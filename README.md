# Orewa

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Leonidas-from-XIV/orewa.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Leonidas-from-XIV/orewa)

俺は - an Async friendly Redis binding.

Currently in early state, use at your own risk. Only most fundamental Redis
commands are implemented.

## Roadmap

Very preliminary but here's what you can sort of expect.

### 1.x

Most (all?) sensible Redis commands

### 2.x

Transactions in Redis

### 3.x

Cluster support, maybe. Unlikely to happen any time soon.
